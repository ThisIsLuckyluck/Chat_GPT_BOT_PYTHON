The program is working using python on discord, so you have to create your bot in the developer portal and then get the token of the discord bot to put it on the program.
I will not detailled how work the bot, I mean, I think everyone has use chatgpt one time in his life, if it's not your case then I don't know why you fall here xD.
The webhook part is not necessary for the bot to work. You can also change the model of the bot, in this code it's 3.5 turbo but you can chabge it if you want t

Last things, DO NOT SHARE token to anyone even to your dog...
